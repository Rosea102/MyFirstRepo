Hello! My name is Viyof Chelsea Vuwesi, an ALX pathway learner. I am presently learning how to use GitHub to manage and collaborate on learning on coding projects. I have a growing interest in technology and digital tools that help streamline work and learning. I enjoy solving problems and learning new skills, and working with others to build useful and creative ideas and solutions.
